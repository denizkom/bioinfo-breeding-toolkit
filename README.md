# 🌿 Bioinfo Breeding Toolkit

**A curated collection of Python-based tools and workflows for genomic data analysis, SNP discovery, QTL matching, and GWAS in plant breeding.**

---

## 📦 Contents

- `gc_content/` — Calculate GC content and detect invalid bases in FASTA/sequence data
- `snp_panel_generation/` — Scripts for filtering VCFs and extracting flanking regions
- `qtl_matching/` — Match SNP positions to annotated gene/QTL regions
- `gwas_analysis/` — Perform GWAS using PLINK or pandas-based pipelines
- `data_visualization/` — Plot distributions, Manhattan plots, summary charts

---

## 🧬 Goals

- Analyze real genomic data (FASTA, GFF3, VCF, RNA-seq counts)
- Generate publication-ready summaries and plots
- Demonstrate coding ability and biological insight for plant genomics
